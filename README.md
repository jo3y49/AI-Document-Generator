# AI Document Generator

## Current Features:

- Upload and remove pdf and word documents
- Generate a document containing all text from both the user's typed text, and their uploaded documents. Serves as a placeholder for the AI generated documents for now

## Future Features:

- Add profiles that each hold their own uploaded documents
- Integrate AI to read 2 different types of files and generate a document based on them. The documents are:
  - Template documents that are an example of what the format of the generated model should be, along with the user's written description of what they need
  - Informational documents that the model references to create the requested document
- Make a runnable exe for anyone to use this program
